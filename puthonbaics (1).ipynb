        "\n",
        "   -> **Versatility** : Pythonâ€™s versatility makes it the ultimate \"one language for all\" solution.\n",
        "      **Simplicity**  : it is very easy to learn & use.\n",
        "      **Good ecosystem** : Rich ecosystem of library.\n",
        "2.  Describe the role of predefined keywords in Python and provide examples of how they are used in a program ?\n",
        "   -> Keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings and are part of the language's syntax.\n",
        "   ex. if (x > 5) and (y < 10):\n",
        "    print(\"Valid\")\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  Compare and contrast mutable and immutable objects in Python with examples\n",
        "   -> Mutable objects can be altered after creation. Common examples include lists, dictionaries, and sets. When you modify a mutable object, Python updates it in place without creating a new object. This efficiency comes with a trade-off: since mutable objects can change, they may lead to unintended side effects, especially when passed into functions.\n",

        "print(fruits)  # Output: [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\"]\n",
        "\n",
        "   Immutable objects, once created, cannot be modified. Examples include integers, strings, and tuples. Any operation that appears to change an immutable object actually creates a new object in memory.\n",

        "6.  How do conditional statements work in Python? Illustrate with examples\n",
